# Untouched Ubuntu

A bunch of links and scripts to get you started with your brand new, untouched ubuntu! **My recommendation is to always install the latest Ubuntu. There is no need to struggle with past versions.**

Usually, it is pain to configure everything and to hunt down every guide there is.

So I have collected a few:

* [Things to do after installing Ubuntu 14.40 - Utopic Unicorn](http://howtoubuntu.org/things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-14-10-utopic-unicorn) - Really good guide for start. Almost every script from here (without google chrome) is incorporated in `[ubuntu_fresh_start.sh](ubuntu_fresh_start.sh)`
